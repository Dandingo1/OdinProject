        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>3 medium green, unripe plantains</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic paste</li>
            <li>6 ounces pork rinds or cracklings, crushed</li>
        </ul>

        <br />

        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>

            <li>
                Heat about 2 inches of oil in a frying pan or deep fryer to
                350F.
            </li>

            <li>
                While the oil is heating up, peel the plantains and cut into
                1-inch rounds.
            </li>

            <li>
                Fry the plantains until golden and tender. This will take
                approximately 4 to 6 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Remove cooked plantains from the pan or fryer and allow to drain
                on paper towels.
            </li>

            <li>
                Put the garlic paste in a mixing bowl or mortar and add the
                fried plantains. Mash until thoroughly blended.
            </li>

            <li>
                Add the pork rinds. Continue to mash and mix until all of the
                ingredients are well incorporated.
            </li>

            <li>Shape the mofongo into 4 balls.</li>

            <li>
                Alternatively, you can make the mofongo into a half-dome shape
                using a small condiment bowl as a mold; push a portion of
                mofongo down to the bottom of the bowl.
            </li>

            <li>
                With the back of a spoon, smooth over and level off the mix.
            </li>

            <li>
                Then use the spoon to scrape around the bowl and remove the mash
                in a half-dome shape.
            </li>

            <li>Serve the mofongo hot and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
