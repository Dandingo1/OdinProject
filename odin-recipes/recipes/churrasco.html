        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds (8 links) linguiça</li>

            <li>2 pounds (7 each) tiger prawns</li>

            <li>1 cup olive oil</li>

            <li>1 cup (30 cloves) garlic, roughly chopped</li>

            <li>1 cup orange juice</li>

            <li>¼ cup lime juice</li>

            <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon fresh oregano, roughly chopped</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon light brown sugar</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon cinnamon</li>

            <li>1 red onion, thinly sliced</li>

            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>

            <li>Three 1-pound top sirloin steaks</li>
        </ul>

                Prepare the churrasco: In a large bowl, combine all the
                churrasco ingredients, except the steaks, and toss until
                incorporated. Let marinate for 1 hour. Skewer the steaks on a
                large metal skewer, curving them to form a C shape.
            </li>

            <li>
                Meanwhile, make the chimichurri: Light a grill. Cook the
                scallions, turning often, until lightly charred and slightly
                wilted, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let
                cool. Mince the scallions, then transfer to a small bowl. Whisk
                in the remaining chimichurri ingredient until a smooth sauce
                comes together.
            </li>

            <li>
                Season the skewered steaks with salt and pepper, and place on
                the grill with the sausage and prawns. Cook, turning
                occasionally until all the meats are lightly charred, the prawns
                are cooked through and the steak is medium rare, about 15
                minutes. Transfer to a board and let rest for 5 minutes, then
                carve and serve with the chimichurri.
